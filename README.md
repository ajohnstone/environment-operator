# Environment operator

The purpose of Environment Operator is to provide a seamless application deployment capability for a given environment within Kubernetes. It can easily hook into existing CI/CD pipeline capabilities including our [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/deployment-pipeline-jenkins-plugin) as well as a typical Jenkins server through a [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator-jenkins-plugin).



Each environment (development, staging, production) has itâ€™s own definition and a separate endpoint to perform deployments.

Currently Environment Operator supports Deployments, Services, Ingress and HorizonPodAutoscaler.
We are actively working on Jobs and Stateful sets.

We also provide and [Operations Guide](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator/blob/dev/Operatonal_Guide.md) for those deploying and managing Environment Operator itself.
